## Project description:
**In this project I explore the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.**

**Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:**
  * What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
  * How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
  * How many adverts are for private rooms?
  * How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

**These are the parts of the data analysis used to answer these questions aka project pipeline:**
   *   Importing the data
   *   Cleaning the columns
   *   Calculating average price
   *   Comparing costs to the private rental market
   *   Determining the timeframe
   *   Joining the DataFrames.
   *   Analysing listing prices by NYC borough
   *   Displaying the price range by borough
